# Servo Control via USB using the Pololu Maestro 6-Channel USB Servo Controller with Python

There is almost nothing on the web on how to use one of these Maestro Servo Controllers using Python. 
Typically users manipulate the Maestro via a graphical interface tool provided by Pololu. This tool
can program Maestro controller to start stop the motors in a continious loop fashion. If control were part of
a system that need to start or stop servos at will, then a language like Python would be required.
As a result I have put together this complete instruction. Please see the Jupyter notebook output file.
